-----basic points ----

> Used for small function that uses very often, Especially library functions.

> Increase the execution time.

> During the fuction call the code is replced with inline function.

> Due to this, The code size will increase.

> The key word "static" have to use before inline fuction declaration.
  Otherwise linker error will occure for GCC compiler.   
  error >>> "undefined reference to `addition"
  


------Example------

#include <stdio.h>

static inline int addition(int a,int b){
    
    return a+b;
}

int main() {
	//code
	printf("sum of 2 and 3 is : %d",addition(2,3));
	return 0;
}

output >>> 	sum of 2 and 3 is : 5
